PROBLEM STATEMENT

The analysis and prediction of best city to stay based on water supply, land value based on the water supply rate and electricity supply rate are unable to find. The prediction of whether the land value increases or decreases based on increase in water supply rate, difference in the land value between two cities, whether the land value depends on water supply and electricity supply rate and forecast for the next 12 monthâ€™s land value are difficult to find.

OBJECTIVE

1. To analyze and forecast from the data set to predict which city is the best city to stay.
2. To predict the land value of the city if water supply rate changes and also if electricity supply rate changes.
3. To predict whether the land value increases or decreases based on the water supply rate.
4. To analyze the difference in land value between two cities
5. To predict whether the land value depends on water supply and electricity supply rate.
6. To forecast the land value for next 12 months.
